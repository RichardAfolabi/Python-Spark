# Apache Spark, Python

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Python and an optimized engine that supports general computation 
graphs for data analysis. It also supports Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
